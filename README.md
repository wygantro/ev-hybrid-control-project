# Electric AWD Sedan Electric Drive Analysis
This report compares simulation results using Matlab/Simulink analyzing the performance of all-wheel drive EVs. The goal is to simulate a design that balances high performance (top speed and acceleration) with drive efficiency by optimizing a transmission system's switching frequency and location (front or rear motor) to the electric drive motors.

The search for best design utilized an EV powertrain simulink model and varying design inputs from Matlab scripts. The analysis varied inputs such as a baseline model with no transmission, a front or rear transmission location configuration and different gear switching frequencies.
